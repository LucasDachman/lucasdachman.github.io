brief: "An Android app that calculates resistor values according to color codes"
---

A productivity app aimed at electrical engineers for determining information on resistors. The app has tabs for each type of resistor (4/5/6 band). Any details about a resistor can be determined by inputting the colors of the bands on a resistor. With this app, one can avoid memorizing complicated charts. The UI/UX was designed in Adobe XD.
