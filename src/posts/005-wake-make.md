brief: "A moving typographic sculpture"
---

This kinetic typographic sculpture explores the relationship between language, form and technology. The reflexive content of the letterforms is a manifestation of how technology and art have fused as a result of maker culture. The movement within the work reminds us that reading is a durational and embodied experience that expands beyond the typically static nature of words.
