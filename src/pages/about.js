          <p>
            I design and write code for web apps, mobile devices, and music.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a student at CU Boulderâ€™s College of Engineering, I graduated
            with a bachelor's degree in{" "}
            <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/atlas/academics/undergraduate">
              Creative Technology &amp; Design
            </a>{" "}
            (previously, TAM) where I participated in a broad, transdisciplinary
            curriculum that integrated technological skills with a critical,
            theoretical and historical understanding of creativity, technology
            and design.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past couple years I have worked to co-found a SaaS based
            company called <a href="https://dialed.ai/">Dialed.ai</a> that makes
            productivity software.
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I like reading Sci-Fi, playing with synthesizers,
            and snowboarding.
